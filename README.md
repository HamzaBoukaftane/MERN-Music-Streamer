## MERN Web Music Streamer

This repository houses a web-based music streamer application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It allows users to:

* **Listen to music:** Stream and explore a collection of music tracks.
* (Optional) Create playlists: Organize favorite music for easy access (functionality can be added).
* (Optional) User accounts: Allow users to personalize their experience (functionality can be added).

**Getting Started:**

Before you dive in, there are a few prerequisites:

1. **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. **MongoDB Atlas account:** Sign up for a free MongoDB Atlas account at [https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2](https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2) to create your own MongoDB cluster for data storage.

**Installation:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mern-music-streamer.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd mern-music-streamer
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file:**

   **Important:** This repository does not include a `.env` file for security reasons. You'll need to create one yourself and add your MongoDB cluster credentials. Here's an example structure for your `.env` file:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-name>.mongodb.net/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your actual MongoDB connection details retrieved from your Atlas cluster.

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start  # or yarn start
   ```

   This will launch the application in development mode, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000/` in your web browser.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided code may not include functionalities like user accounts and playlists yet. Feel free to explore adding these features as you customize the application.
* Refer to the specific documentation for MongoDB Atlas, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js for in-depth guidance on each technology used in this project.
